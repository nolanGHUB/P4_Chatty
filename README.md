## Overview

**Chatty** is a fullstack application that replicates a now "retro" messenger system.  From a Ruby/Rails/Sqlite DB backend to power the login, authentication, friends lists and chat message logs.  To the React based frontend styling a retro AIM-like (AOL Instant Messenger) design for clients to connect to._

### Team Member(s)

Created, designed, and developed by Nolan Giles (November '19 General Assembly SEI Cohort) Unit 4 Project.

## MVP


The **Chatty** MVP will allow users to connect via React front-end using a Registration system of email/name/password and login using email/password. It will prevent duplicate registrations and utilize a token-based local-login storage for persistence. As well as a fully bcrypt hashed password for security.
Users will be able to have a personalized friend/buddy list and add/remove friends. Users will be able to access a general chat-room allowing them to talk with everyone. Full CRUD showcasing in the following features: Creating: Friends/Users/Messages, Receiving: Messages and Online Users, Updating: Usernames & Deleting: Friends.

<br>

### MVP Goals

- _3 Modeled tables: users/ friends / chat_messages_
- Full CRUD showcasing in the following features: Creating: Friends/Users/Messages, Receiving: Messages and Online Users, Updating: Usernames & Deleting: Friends.
- Fully functioning friend list allowing additions and removals.
- Functioning Chatroom capable of housing and displaying all messages as well as providing a brief log of most recent said messages upon login.

### Stretch Goals

- Direct messaging! 1 to 1 messaging between friends.
- DRAGGABLE WINDOWS - probably not happening!
- Better styling, really trying to hit that 1:1 repoduction!
- A flip switch to toggle design from old to modern - suggestion from uxdi designer
- EMOJIS!
- ANIMATED EMOJIS
